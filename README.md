# KITT
Kermit Image Toolkit (KITT)

This set of folders contain a long list of methods and utilities for image processing, as they have been gathered over the years. All code is distributed as functions, so no runnable code for specific experiments will be included in this project.

Feel free to use any of the code, or to build upon it.

## Main information

**What is is, the KITT?** The Kermit Image ToolkiT (KITT) is a collection of code pieces in Matlab aimed at easing Image Processing tasks. The KITT is (as of today) distributed in four different packages, each of them containing different functions in Matlab. Some of these functions implement our own methods, while other embody well-known tasks in literature.

As long as some interdependences exist, we recommend users to download the whole KITT (which is only some KB’s), even if readers shall be interested in just a subset of them.

**How to use the KITT?**  The KITT is very simple to use. Researchers only need to download and unzip the file below (in this same page). Then, they only need to configure Matlab’s path to include the folders of the KITT. This is normally done by using the command path(path,X), where X needs to be replaced by the (local or global) path of the folders in which the KITT has been deployed/unzipped.

**Which is the license of the KITT?** The KITT is distributed under the GNU GPL license. This is individually stated in every single file of the KITT. However, interested researchers must be aware that intellectual rights, as well as rights of many other types, might apply on the algorithms, the names or the code itself. Please be careful with this.

**How to cite or reference the KITT?** If using the KITT, please cite it as
