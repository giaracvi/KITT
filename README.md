# KITT
Kermit Image Toolkit (KITT)

This set of folders contain a long list of methods and utilities for image processing, as they have been gathered over the years. All code is distributed as functions, so no runnable code for specific experiments will be included in this project.

Feel free to use any of the code, or to build upon it.
